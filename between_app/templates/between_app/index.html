<h2>Profile: </h2>
<p>Therapeutic Profiles is a project to help therapist and clients to find their unique needs, having names to organise the complexities of human beings.</p>
<p>They aim to move between the old traditions, in a context where therapist and clients are learning from multiple points of view and mixing ideas and practices from many sources becomes the new norm.</p>
