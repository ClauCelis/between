<h3>Therapeutic Position:</h3>
<p>Therapeutic positions are a way of conceptualising client work. We all move through positions in life. Different schools stress some positions more than others, and also the personality of the therapist makes them tend towards one position more often.</p>
<p>My idea is that we need to learn from the different therapeutic positions to overcome their 'shadows', the parts that become hidden of our personality and tradition.</p>
<p>Many new traditions are placed in-between positions, making the current landscape more fluid. This model aims to help therapist and clients to identify the positions where they feel more comfortable and which ones feel harder.</p>

    <p>This paths can be mixed up, and we benefit by learning from the different angles of the other paths. Sometimes we may change where our curiosity is leading us over time.</p>
